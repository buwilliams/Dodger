# Dodger
 My first 2d video game in Unity.
 
## Object of Game

The object of the game is to survive until you reach the exit. Spiked platforms are charging at you as you try and dodge your demise.

## Features

- Move player with A (left) and D (right)
- Restart level when the player collides with a spike
- Complete a level when the player collides with the exit
- Implmentation of Finite State Machine. See: [Assets/GameState](Assets/GameState)
- Audio: Background music, spike collision, and exit collision

## Purpose

I wanted to get familiar with the Unity Game Engine, Unity UI, and the general process for creating games within Unity. I follow a simple process, shown in this video.

## My process for learning Unity.

[I learned the process from Mark Brown.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFjXKOXdgGo&list=PLc38fcMFcV_uH3OK4sTa4bf-UXGk2NW2n&index=2)

1. Learn the [absolute basics about Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6A4WvsDeLE) and the [same for C#](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFayQioG71A&list=PLzDRvYVwl53t2GGC4rV_AmH7vSvSqjVmz).
2. Reimplement [existing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_genres) to solidify Unity concepts. Rinse and Repeat.
3. Once, I've reimplemented enough games and full ready, I'll try and build my own game.
